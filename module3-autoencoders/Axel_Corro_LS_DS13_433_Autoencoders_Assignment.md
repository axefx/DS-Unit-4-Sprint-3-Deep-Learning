# Today's Assignment

Read About the History of General Artificial Intelligence Research, the future of AGI, and modern AI safety concerns. Write down your thoughts in the form of two-three questions you would ask your classmates. Please review the following resources:

* [History of Artificial Intelligence](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/)
  * `What allowed for artificial intelligence to overcome the roller coaster of success and setbacks?`
    * limit of computer storage was no longer a problem
  * `What was Turing’s suggestion and main problem for not pursuing?`
    * funding and storage of commands
  * `What are some limitations faced today in artificial intelligence?`
    * it is not generalisable

* [How far-are we from achieving artificial general intelligence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/06/10/how-far-are-we-from-achieving-artificial-general-intelligence/#e8aa1876dc4d)
  * `What is implide with the statement that the gap between artificial general intelligence and human intelligence is diminishing at a rapid rate?`
    * that powerful ai systems may not be too far out in the future
  * `In what year is general intelligence being predicted to be reached in development?`
    * years 2030 to 2060

* [Humans Fascination with artificial general intellgience](https://www.informationweek.com/big-data/ai-machine-learning/humans-fascination-with-artificial-general-intelligence/a/d-id/1334885)
  * `What has been the driving goal for artificial intelligence development?`
    * for ai to have capabilities functionally equivalent to a human
  * `What is more likely to happen ai harness control over humans or humans harness control over ai?`
    * humans will control ai by achieving symbiosis.

* [Risks from Articial Intelligence](https://www.cser.ac.uk/research/risks-from-artificial-intelligence/)
  * `What are repercussions of super intelligence on privacy and freedom of choice?`
    * bad actor misuse
  * `What is another invention that can have this much implication on human existence and is there a safety presence around it?`
    * it migth have similar destabilising dynamics of an arms race.

* [AI Safety Concerns](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/9/18174081/fhi-govai-ai-safety-american-public-worried-ai-catastrophe)
  * `What are some problems being faced today?`
    * data privacy, digital manipulation
  * `What demographics were highlighted as the being the most worried and least worried?`
    * women, and lower income were more worried, less worried were people with computer backgrounds.
